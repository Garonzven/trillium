Founded in 2014, by designers Leonard, OrionStudio is a global brand and design agency with offices in the creative hubs of London and San Francisco.

I opened the agency after spotting a split in the creative industry. Studios were either boutique and beautiful, but only managing to work on a few projects or of a massive scale and impersonal with their client relationships. DesignStudio was created with the aim to fill this gap – delivering the quality of boutique, bespoke design to global brands and audiences.
